# MutationPseudoGame
Created for the course ORI (Osnove Računarske Inteligencije, eng. Fundamentals of Artificial Inteligence) of FTN (Fakultet Tehničkih Nauka, Faculty of Technical Sciences).

Features two warring factions that fight one another over a set number of generations, during which they mutate in order to gain edge over the opponent.
Generations that deal with the opponent in the most swift manner will be chosen as models for the next generations of mutating move sets, but the ultimate goal is not to create a proper gaming opponent, but rather to simulate evolution through natural selection in which vestigial traits are preserved, as long as they do not impair the outcome.
Results of particular generations will be printed out in a file, as well as the log containing some basic information about all game generations.
